//: ## Variables 
//: In these exercises, you will create variables and constants, and you will handle simple compiler areas that arise when working with them.
//: ### Exercise 1
//: For each of the following names and types, create a variable or constant that best represents it:

var gallonsRemainingInTank: (Double)
gallonsRemainingInTank = 40.39
var ageOfSpecimenInWeeks: (Int)
ageOfSpecimenInWeeks = 4
let studentNickname: (String)
studentNickname = "Junior"
var teaspoonsNutmeg: (Float)
teaspoonsNutmeg = 2.13


//: ### Exercise 2
//: Fix the following compiler errors related to assignment, variables, and constants:
var favoriteLanguage: String = "Swift"
gallonsRemainingInTank = 2.035
ageOfSpecimenInWeeks = 32
let teaspoonsCinnamon: Float = teaspoonsNutmeg


//: ### Exercise 3
//: Below is some code to reverse a string. We've declared the entities stringToReverse and arrayOfCharacters as variables. Rewrite this code to reverse a string using only constants declared with let, no variables. Note: In the new version you may use as many constants as you'd like.
var stringToReverse = "Mutable or Immutable? That is the question."
var arrayOfCharacters = stringToReverse.characters.reversed()
stringToReverse = String(arrayOfCharacters)

/*
//:### Exercise 4
//: For the following descriptions, create a variable or constant that best represents it:

- an Int value representing the hunger level of an animal over time.
- an Int value representing the score always required to win a game.
- a String value representing a studentâ€™s birthday.
- a String value representing what a user types into the status update area.
